# Uncovering the Enigma of Type-Ia Supernovae: Thermonuclear Supernova Classification via their Nuclear Signatures
#### Google Summer of Code: Sophia He
#### Mentors: Richard Miller, James Mastandrea, Patrick Peplowski

This repository contains the Jupyter Notebook developed for the Google Summer of Code program for the Lunar Occulation eXplorer project at Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory.
The purpose of the project is to investigate machine learning as a potential route for thermonuclear supernova research and classification.
The notebook consists of a cluster-predict pipeline, first identifying clustering patterns in the dataset (from observable parameters), then utilizing multi-output regression for physical parameter predictions.
